Shiny app to view past cy young data and a cy young prediction tool





The prestigious Cy Young Award has been given out each year (beginning in 1967) to the best pitcher in both the American and National Leagues. It has always been a well known fact that media bias plays a big role, with a focus on result driven statistics such as Wins, ERA, and WHIP in the awarding of the Cy Young. Age and region of the team also contribute to this bias. This shiny app was intended to view past trends for Cy Young winners, with a fun prediction tool that predicts future cy young winners based on these biases.
