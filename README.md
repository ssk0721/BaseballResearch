Past Baseball Research

This is collection of past baseball research I was able to accomplish in my undergraduate years (2019-2023). These projects utilize relatively simple
methods compared to what I learned through working in a MLB front office; however, I can not share my most recent work with 
predictive models for obvious reasons. I have included the code and data that was used, along with the finished papers related to each question.
